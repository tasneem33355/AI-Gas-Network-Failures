# AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance Dashboard for Gas Networks  

This project aims to build an **interactive AI-powered dashboard** that predicts failures in gas pipeline networks before they happen.  
The system will provide real-time insights, predictive alerts, and visualizations to help reduce costs, save time, and improve operational safety.

## 🎯 Project Vision  
From the very first phase, the project will not only include machine learning models,  
but also provide a **dashboard** that allows operators to:  

- Monitor gas pipeline parameters in real time (pressure, flow, temperature, vibration, etc.).  
- Visualize data trends through interactive charts.  
- Receive **predictive alerts** when there is a high probability of failure.  
- Save **money, time, and resources** by preventing unplanned maintenance.  
- Improve **safety and efficiency** across the gas network.
